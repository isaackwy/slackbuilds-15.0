This is a fork of Mint-Y-Icons which brings back monochrome icons.

Since Linux Mint 21.2, monochrome icons had been replaced by symbolic
ones. However, the missing icons are inherited from other themes
(ex. Adwaita), making the visual experience mixed and inconsistent.

The fork addresses visual inconsistency issues within certain
applications (ex. BleachBit).
