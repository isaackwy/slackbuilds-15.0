dwmblocks is a modular status bar for dwm written in C.

This build of dwmblocks, by UtkarshVerma, is asynchronous (that is,
each status block updates independently of one another) and handles
mouse clicks.

If a config.h is found in the SlackBuild directory it will be copied to
the source directory and used in the build, allowing easy customisation.
