archy-slstatus is archy's fork of slstatus (a status bar for dwm).

suckless's slstatus (the original) is available at:
https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/

If a config.h is found in the SlackBuild directory it will be copied to
the source directory and used in the build, allowing easy customisation.
