libratbag provides ratbagd, a DBus daemon to configure input devices,
mainly high-end and gaming mice.

This Slackbuild does not build documentation files by default.
To build documentation files (which additionally requires Sphinx 
and sphinx-rtd-theme), run the script with the following command:

DOCS=yes ./libratbag.SlackBuild
