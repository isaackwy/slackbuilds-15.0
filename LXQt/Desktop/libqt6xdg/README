libqt6xdg is a Qt 6 implementation of freedesktop.org XDG
specifications.

The library is able to use GTK+ icon theme caches for faster
icon lookup. The cache file can be generated with utility
gtk-update-icon-cache on a theme directory. If the cache is not
present, corrupted, or outdated, the normal slow lookup is still run.

libqt6xdg can be installed alongside libqtxdg (which instead supports
qt5).
