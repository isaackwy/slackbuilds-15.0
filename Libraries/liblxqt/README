liblxqt represents the core library of LXQt providing essential
functionality needed by nearly all of its components.

ponce repository (https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds/) has 
libqtxdg 3.6.0. This SlackBuild instead depends on
libqtxdg 3.8.0.

This SlackBuild also requires kwindowsystem and polkit-qt-1
(available in default Slackware repo). After all, not everyone
installs KDE.
