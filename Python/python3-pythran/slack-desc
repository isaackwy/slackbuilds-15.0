 HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-pythran: python-pythran (Ahead of Time compiler for numeric kernels)
python-pythran:
python-pythran: Pythran is an ahead of time compiler for a subset of the Python
python-pythran: language, with a focus on scientific computing. It takes a Python
python-pythran: module annotated with a few interface descriptions and turns it into a
python-pythran: native Python module with the same interface, but (hopefully) faster.
python-pythran:
python-pythran: It is meant to efficiently compile scientific programs, and takes
python-pythran: advantage of multi-cores and SIMD instruction units.
