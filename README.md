This repository contains slackbuilds which I am maintaining for Slackware 15.0. Slackbuilds on this repository are unofficial - these are scripts prepared for uploading to the SlackBuilds.org repository.

Data science slackbuilds are available in the 'Data_Science' folder.  
LXQt slackbuilds are available in the 'LXQt' folder.  
Qtile slackbuilds are available in the 'Qtile' folder.  
Other slackbuilds are available in the 'Other' folder.  

If you have any questions, please contact me by email, listed with the Slackbuild or info files.

Enjoy!
